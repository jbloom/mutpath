    certain ambiguous nucleotides may still be translatable if they all lead to 
    the same amino acid.

    The optional argument *readthrough_stop* specifies that if we encounter
    any stop codons, we simply translation them to '*'.  By default,
    this option is *False*, meaning that we instead raise an error
    of an incomplete stop codon.

    The optional argument *truncate_incomplete* specifies that if the sequence
    length is not a multiple of three, we simply truncate off the one or two
    final nucleotides to make the length a multiple of three prior to translation.
    By default, this option is *False*, meaning that no such truncation is done.

    This method is designed to extract sequences from a FASTA file.  It will work
    even if the FASTA file is very large, since it avoids reading the entire
    file into memory at once. 

    *namelist* specifies the "names" of the sequences that we want to extract from
    the FASTA file.  The "name" of a sequence is the string immediately following
    the ">" in the FASTA file header for a sequence, terminated by a space character

    would correspond to a name of "E_coli_thioredoxin".  'namelist' specifies
    a list of these names.

    *fastafile* is the name of a FASTA file that contains the sequences we are searching
    for.  For this method to be guaranteed to work properly, each sequence in the FASTA
    file must contain a unique name, where a "name" is as defined above.  Note that this
    uniqueness of names is not rigorously checked for, so if there are not unique names,
