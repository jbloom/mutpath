`mutpath`_ is a Python package for identifying mutational paths through sequence space generated using the MarkovJumps feature of `BEAST`_. 

`mutpath`_ documentation is available at http://jbloom.github.com/mutpath/

`mutpath`_ was written by `Jesse Bloom`_. It takes advantage of the MarkovJumps feature added to `BEAST`_ by `Marc Suchard`_. The reference for this approach to building mutational paths is `Gong et al, 2013`_, and this package can be used to build mutational paths similar to that shown in `Figure 2A` of that paper.

`mutpath`_ source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jbloom/mutpath
