`mutpath`_ is a Python package for identifying mutational paths through sequence space generated using the MarkovJumps feature of `BEAST`_. 

`mutpath`_ source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jbloom/mutpath

`mutpath`_ documentation is available at http://jbloom.github.com/mutpath/

`mutpath`_ was written by `Jesse Bloom`_. It takes advantage of the MarkovJumps feature added to `BEAST`_ by `Marc Suchard`_. 

If you use this software package, please cite the following reference for `mutpath`_'s approach to building mutational paths: `Gong et al, 2013`_.

`mutpath`_ is free software under the `GPLv3`_ license.

Specific examples of usage included in this package:

    * A description of how to build mutational paths similar to that in `Figure 2A` of `Gong et al, 2013`_ can be found at http://jbloom.github.io/mutpath/example_influenza_human_H3N2_NP.html

    * A description of the process used to build the mutational paths in `Gong and Bloom, 2014`_ is at http://jbloom.github.io/mutpath/example_influenza_NP_1918_Descended.html
