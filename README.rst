`mutpath`_ is a Python package for identifying mutational paths through sequence space generated using the MarkovJumps feature of `BEAST`_. 

`mutpath`_ source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jbloom/mutpath

`mutpath`_ documentation is available at http://jbloom.github.com/mutpath/

`mutpath`_ was written by `Jesse Bloom`_. It takes advantage of the MarkovJumps feature added to `BEAST`_ by `Marc Suchard`_. The reference for this approach to building mutational paths is `Gong et al, 2013`_.

Specific examples of usage included in this package:

    * A description of how to build mutational paths similar to that in `Figure 2A` of `Gong et al, 2013`_ can be found at http://jbloom.github.io/mutpath/example_influenza_human_H3N2_NP.html
