Scripts
=====================================

Installation of `mutpath`_ installs a set of scripts that can be run directly from the command line. These scripts perform all of the main functions of the package. You should be able to utilize the full functionality simply by running these scripts, without interacting directly with the `Python`_ code.

Here are the scripts:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   mutpath_parse_to_beastxml
   mutpath_compact_trees
   mutpath_get_paths
   mutpath_annotate_tree
   mutpath_make_digraph


.. include:: weblinks.txt
